SimpleInjectorExtensionApp
==========================

Demo applicarion with integrated the IoC Simple Injector in XAML code

Final ViewModel is emitted by free DevExpress MVVM Framework, this greatly simplfies the ViewModel code:
- POCO property instead of property with INPC implementation
- simple method instead of DelegateCommand / RelayCommand

Complete documentation is here:
https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WPF/CustomDocument15112

This is the best MVVM Framework I've ever seen.
